## The Problem

Complaints bounce between departments. 6 weeks later: unresolved. No one owns it.

**Root cause:** Mandate boundaries between departments are unclear. When multiple departments can say "this isn't my responsibility," complaints disappear.

**This project:** Diagnoses structural ownership gaps using information theory. Quantifies the impact. Proposes fixes.

---

## Real Data Analysis

3,026 actual BBMP complaints analyzed.

**Key finding:** All 6 analyzed complaint categories exhibited high ownership fragmentation (entropy ≥ 0.98)

**With unified mandates:** Projected resolution efficiency improvements of 25–29%

## Analytical Outputs

### Ownership Entropy Analysis

![Entropy Visualization](results/notebook_01/entropy_visualization.png)

High entropy = fragmented ownership = slower resolution

### Accountability Decay Modeling

![Accountability Decay Curves](results/notebook_02/accountability_decay_curve.png)

Each department transfer → responsibility erodes exponentially. Half-life: 28–38 days.

### Counterfactual Governance Simulation

**Scenario: What if we unified mandate ownership?**

![Resolution Efficiency Gains](results/notebook_03/resolution_efficiency_gains.png)

**Result:** 25–29% projected resolution efficiency improvement across all complaint types.

## The Math (Three Core Metrics)

**1. Ownership Entropy**
Measures how fragmented departmental ownership is for a complaint type.
- 0.0–0.3 = Clear owner ✅
- 0.7–1.0 = Fragmented (mandate vacuum) 🔴

Formula: `H = -Σ p(i) × log₂(p(i))`

**2. Accountability Half-Life**
Models how quickly responsibility decays as complaints transfer between departments.
- Each transfer = exponential loss, not linear
- Reflects real-world diffusion of accountability

Formula: `R(t) = R₀ × e^(-λt)`

**3. Counterfactual Simulator**
Isolates impact of mandate reassignment: "If primary ownership were unified, what efficiency improvement?"

## What's Built

**Analysis Layer** (Python)
Jupyter notebooks computing entropy, decay, counterfactual simulations from real municipal complaint data.

**Dashboard** (React + TypeScript)
Bilingual (English/Tamil) interactive interface:
- Vacuums: Entropy scores by category
- Decay: Half-life accountability curves
- Simulator: Governance policy scenarios
- Insights: AI-synthesized recommendations (Gemini API)

**Status:** Functional analytical prototype validated on real municipal complaint data.

## Why This Approach

| Aspect | Traditional System | Mandate Vacuum |
|---|---|---|
| Question | "Where is my complaint?" | "Why won't it resolve?" |
| Focuses on | Operational efficiency | Structural ownership |
| For | Citizens | Policy makers |

---

## Validation

✅ Analyzed 3,026 real BBMP complaints  
✅ Higher entropy categories showed longer average resolution times in the dataset  
✅ Model outputs tested against actual complaint patterns  
✅ Interactive dashboard deployed and functional  

---

## Known Limitations

- Decay model uses heuristic coefficients, not empirically calibrated
- Entropy assumes complaint independence (seasonal patterns not modeled)
- Cannot distinguish legitimate inter-department handoffs from accountability diffusion
- Counterfactual projections are theoretical (real-world implementation may vary)

## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/visha-l127/mandate-vacuum-governance-intelligence.git
cd mandate-vacuum-governance-intelligence

# Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook

# Dashboard
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Add Gemini API key to `.env` for live AI insights.

## What This Taught Me

Governance failures are usually structural, not operational. Process improvements won't solve problems rooted in unclear mandate boundaries. This project is a diagnostic tool for identifying where structural reform is needed.

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Empirically validate decay model against actual resolution outcomes
- [ ] Develop category-specific accountability coefficients
- [ ] Expand to other municipalities
- [ ] Build API for municipality data integration
